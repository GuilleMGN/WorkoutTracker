# WorkoutTracker

## Description
This project is a fitness app that lets users input a workout and its details. They have options to add a resistance workout or cardio workout. For resistance you can add the workouts name, weight, sets, reps, and duration. The cardio allows the user to add the workouts name, distasnce and duration. On the dashboard, the user can view their statistics and all the workouts are displayed in the charts. The application is hosted on Heroku. 

## Usage
To use the application locally, you would have to install the node modules ('npm init -y'). The NPM package dependencies are 'npm i express', 'npm i mongoose' and 'npm i morgan'. Once this is complete, open the Terminal/GitBash console and run the code 'node server.js'. This will start the app on localhost:8080 in your browser. All workouts are stored into the Robo 3T Mongo database.
